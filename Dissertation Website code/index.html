                <h2>What is Crowdfunding?</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this research is to review literature around an online crowdfunding
                    projects. To investigate the motivations behind why an online entrepreneur (in this case an artist/influencer) would decide a crowdfund campaign on Indiegogo was better to gain the finances, than a traditional method of funding a project like an angel investor (Gera & Kaur, 2017). Also, what motivated her Instagram followers to want to contribute
                    to her Crowdfunder (Bretschneider and Leimeister, 2017). 
                    </p>
                
                <p>Crowdfunding is a relatively new phenomenon that has come about in the last 10-15 years. It is means of acquiring investment for a project, but instead of getting funding from one angel investor (traditional way), you gain small amounts of capital from multiple investors. This has many advantages as it could be quicker as you set your own deadline and could have much lower costs as you remove any intermediates. The disadvantages could be that you won’t hit your target if not promoted enough or if you have too many passive followers. This could then hurt the success of any future campaigns.</p>

                <h3>Case Study</h3>
                <p>The research of this project was based around a crowdfunding campaign from 2020 by an artist/social media influencer. The campaign was to raise money and awareness for a short indie series which was later to be aired on YouTube. The funding was to help with production costs and was on the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo. The influencer had created a tier reward for the amount people wanted to contribute.  This ranged from 10 dollars which reward was a Button, to 500 dollars where the reward was a custom painting from the artist. These incentives were a reward-based system to motivate people to become a backer for the campaign and is quite popular form for other campaign.
                </p>    
                <p>The data collection was conducted with several interviews, first the influencer herself to gain her reasons for creating the campaign and then some of her followers to gain a perspective on why they did or did not contribute to her campaign. This brought up some interesting findings about transparency being a running theme on the part of the backers. Also, that the creator realised people just wanted to contribute to help support her and that the rewards were a secondary thought.
