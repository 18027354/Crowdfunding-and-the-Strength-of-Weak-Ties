        <h3>Glynn David Wrigley</h3>

        <p>I am a Digital Media and communication student at Manchester Metropolitan University. This project was my dissertation in my final year, I choose the topic of crowdfunding as I had built up a great repute with an artist/influencer. She had created a crowdfunding campaign to finance her project back in 2020, but even though she had over 200k followers on Instagram it failed to meet its target of £4500. This struck me as strange as I would have thought that even a small fraction of her followers would have contributed so she would hit the target. As well as many companies using social media influencers as marketers for their products, it seemed that there was more than meets the eye and the inspiration for the research.  </p>

        <p>After developing a passion for learning in my late twenties early thirties I decided to apply for a degree at university. Being what is now classed as a mature student, it has given me a chance to learn, evolve and better myself with teaching me new skills and knowledge. So, I can build a future and career in the digital industry. From learning coding with html, CSS and JavaScript, to theories based on people’s personas online, how to create digital assets and to promote them online.   </p>

        <p>The hope is you enjoy the research that was created and learn something new about the motivations behind why someone would create a campaign and the reasons for people to want to be a part of them. As my future will hopefully take me into the realms of data science or computer science more research await. </p>
